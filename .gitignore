# We might want to keep models if they are small, but usually we don't commit large pickle files. 
# However, for this specific user project which seems to be a self-contained demo, 
# and they just generated them, maybe they want them?
# Standard practice is NO. But I'll exclude them to be safe and avoid large file errors.
# I will add a note about this.
